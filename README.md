# DSP592 Assignment 4: Python

### This assignment contains 4 files:

  * sequence.txt

  * sequence.py

  * test.py

  * Python Assignment.ipynb

### 1. sequence.txt

It contains 6 lines of sequences with different length. (e.g. ATTTGGATT )  

### 2. sequence.py

Usage: $ python sequence.py filename  k

(e.g. $ python sequence.py ./sequence.txt 2)  

Input **the path to the sequence file** and **the value of k**, the program will read in the sequences line by line and output the **Sequence length**, **Observed kmers**, **Possible kmers**, **linguistic complexity**, and a **data frame**. The graphs will be shown in jupyter notebook.

### 3. test.py

Usage: $ pytest test.py

This script could test 3 functions, **count_okmers**, **count_pkmers**, and **ling_complex** (except frame and plot functions).

### 4. Python Assignment.ipynb

This file could show the output of all functions (include **graphs**).
